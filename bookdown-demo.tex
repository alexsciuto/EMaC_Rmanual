\chapter{How to Install R}\label{download}

This is the EMaC manual for how to wrangle, analyze, and visualize data
in \textbf{R}. I will review a few key packages, in addition to explaing
their key functions, with real data examples.

There are two things you need to do to install R on your computer.
First, you would need to install the latest version of R which you would
download and install from this link:
\href{https://cloud.r-project.org/}{R-download}. Once you run and
install R onto your computer, you would need to install R-Studio. R
studio is the graphic user interface (GUI) where you can place all of
your R-code. Follow this link:
\href{https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/}{R-Studio Desktop
Download}. Once you have these two programs installed, all you need to
do is launch R-studio Desktop and you are ready to go..

\chapter{Introduction to Programming in R}\label{intro}

Before you can do data wrangling, statiscs, and visualization using R
for cognitive psychology research, you need to learn the basic syntax in
R. This chapter will introduce the basics.

\section{Variables in R}\label{variables-in-r}

R can manipulate and wrangle all kinds of data, these data could be
stored in a handful of variables that we can then work with. The first
one we will be talking about is numeric.

\subsection{Numeric}\label{numeric}

a numeric is a number (including decimals) that can be stored within a
variable. Here is an example:

\textbf{\emph{\texttt{x\ =\ 2}}}

Here, we assigned the numeric value \texttt{2} to the variable
\texttt{x}. Thus, if we were to do arithemtic, \texttt{x} will be
treated as \texttt{2}. Moreover, there are specific functions in R we
can use in order to do arithmetic with numeric variables. Here are a few
examples:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}ccc@{}}
\toprule
Arithemtic & R-Input & R-Output\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
Addition: & \texttt{x\ +\ 2} & \texttt{4}\tabularnewline
Substraction: & \texttt{x\ -\ 2} & \texttt{0}\tabularnewline
Division: & \texttt{x\ /\ 2} & \texttt{1}\tabularnewline
Multiplication: & \texttt{x\ *\ 2} & \texttt{4}\tabularnewline
Exponent: & \texttt{x\ \^{}\ 2} & \texttt{4}\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Character}\label{character}

A character is a combination of characters (either letters and/or
numbers) that can be stored within a variable. Moreover, it is very
important that you place the character between quotation marks. Here is
an example:

\textbf{\emph{\texttt{x\ =\ "Cognitive\ Psychology"}}}

Here, we assigned the character value \texttt{"Cognitive\ Psychology"}
to the variable \texttt{x}. There are ways to manipulate character type
variables, and also modify them. However, we will touch on that later.

\subsection{Logical}\label{logical}

A logical can only have two possible values, \texttt{TRUE} and
\texttt{FALSE} that can be stored within a variable. This is not
typically a varaible type that you will need to assign variable values
to. However, the logical type variable is extremely important becuase a
lot of functions in R return a logical variable. We will dive into some
of these functions

\subsection{Vector}\label{vector}

A vector is multiple variables stored into one data-set. Vectors can
contain any variable type: character, numeric, string, and logical. When
you are declaring a a vector type variable, you typically have to use
the concatenate function \texttt{c()}. Here is an example:

\texttt{x\ =\ c(1,2,3,4)}

\texttt{x\ =\ c("I",\ "like",\ "Cognitive",\ "Psychology")}

\texttt{x\ =\ c(TRUE,\ FALSE,\ FALSE,\ TRUE)}

To reference a vector varaible, you need to use \texttt{{[}{]}} and
inside the brackets, you have to specify the index of where the given
variable in the vector is. Here is an example

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{x =}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{c}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"10"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"20"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"30"}\NormalTok{, }\StringTok{"40"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{x[}\DecValTok{4}\NormalTok{]}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "40"
\end{verbatim}

Here, we assigned the numbers: \texttt{10,\ 20,\ 30,\ 40} to the vector
\texttt{x}. \texttt{"Cognitive\ Psychology"} to the variable \texttt{x}.
There are ways to manipulate character type variables, and also modify
them. However, we will touch on that later.

\section{Logical Operators \&
if-Statements}\label{logical-operators-if-statements}

Now that you have a basic understanding of how variables work in R, the
next step is to learn how to use logical operators in order to specifiy
what are the specific conditions under which you want your variables to
be manipulated. The main way to do this in R is by using logical
operators.

\textbf{\emph{\texttt{x\ =\ 2}}}

Here, we assigned the numeric value \texttt{2} to the variable
\texttt{x}. Thus, if we were to apply logical operators to \texttt{x},
\texttt{x} will be treated as \texttt{2}. Here are examples of all of
the logical operators:

\begin{longtable}[]{@{}lccc@{}}
\toprule
Logical Operators & Description & R-Input & R-Output\tabularnewline
\midrule
\endhead
\textless{} & less than & x \textless{} 10 & TRUE\tabularnewline
\textless{}= & less than or equal to & x \textless{}= 2 &
TRUE\tabularnewline
\textgreater{} & greater than & x \textgreater{} 1 & TRUE\tabularnewline
\textgreater{}= & greater than or equal to & x \textgreater{}= 3 &
FALSE\tabularnewline
== & exactly equal to & x == 9 & FALSE\tabularnewline
!= & not equal to & x != 10 & FALSE\tabularnewline
!x & Not x & !x & FALSE\tabularnewline
x \textbar{}~y & x OR y & x == 10 \textbar{}~x != 10 &
TRUE\tabularnewline
x \& y & x AND y & x == 10 \&x != 10 & FALSE\tabularnewline
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

Now that you have a basic understanding of logical operators, we can use
them in order to specify code to manipulate variables in a particular
way. For this example, we will be working with the function
\texttt{if\_else()}. However, one question you may have is what is a
function in R? I will describe the structure of functions, starting with
a simple one.

\chapter{Introduction to Data
Wrangling}\label{introduction-to-data-wrangling}

To introduce data wrangling, we will be working with a dataset from a
study conducted in our lab. Here are the details of the study in order
to understand the data manipulation more:

\section{The study}\label{the-study}

On each trial in this experiment (n = 174), each participant (n = 84)
sees a target word very briefly (e.g., word) and then is prompted to
select which of two letters was in a particular position of that word
(e.g., \_ \_ \_ ↓) - one letter was in the presented word (e.g., D) and
the other letter is in an orthographic neighbor of the word (e.g., K).
This is a 2 (visual field) x 3 (sentence context) experimental design:
the target word is either presented in the fovea (i.e., center of the
screen) or the parafovea (i.e., 3 degrees to the right of fixation).
Prior to the target word, they see a sentence context presented via
Rapid Serial Visual Presentation (RSVP) that constrains to target (i.e.,
makes the presented word predictable and the orthographic neighbor
implausible), constrains to the alternative (i.e., makes the
orthographic neighbor predictable and the presented word implausible),
or is neutral (i.e., makes neither word predictable but both of them
plausible). In addition, we collect data about the individual subjects'
language ability (i.e., their z-score on some test relative to the other
participants), including spelling recognition (i.e., circle which words
are spelled wrong), spelling dictation (i.e., write out words that they
hear said), and phonological decoding (i.e., read aloud a list of words
and a list of nonwords), and information about the lexical properties of
the words (e.g., word frequency, cloze probability, orthographic
neighborhood size, phonological neighborhood size, clustering
coefficient, orthographic similarity to other words, which of the two
words is higher frequency).

\section{Loading in Data}\label{loading-in-data}

\subsection{Loading Packages}\label{loading-packages}

Before we start wrangling the data, we need to load in the packages we
are using. In this lab, most of the data wrangling tools we will be
using will be located in the \texttt{tidyverse()} package. What is a
package? It is simply a group of functions that group of developers made
that makes computations easier. To learn more about the
\texttt{tidyverse} package, you may click on this
\href{https://www.tidyverse.org/}{link} and read on it! For the data
wrangling we will be doing in this section, we will be primarily using a
package within tidyverse called \texttt{dplyr}. to load in the package,
simply type in the following code. What this code is saying is IF you
don't have the \texttt{tidyverse} installed, THEN install the package.
After that, load the \texttt{tidyverse} with the \texttt{library()}
function.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\ControlFlowTok{if}\NormalTok{(}\OperatorTok{!}\KeywordTok{require}\NormalTok{(tidyverse))\{}
    \KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"tidyverse"}\NormalTok{)}
\NormalTok{\}}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(tidyverse) }
\KeywordTok{install.packages}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"kableExtra"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Installing package into '/home/travis/R/Library'
## (as 'lib' is unspecified)
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(kableExtra)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## 
## Attaching package: 'kableExtra'
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## The following object is masked from 'package:dplyr':
## 
##     group_rows
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{setting the working
directory}\label{setting-the-working-directory}

Now that we have the packages that we need, we need to load up our
directory. What is a directory? It is essentially the folder we will be
using to read in files, or export files into. In this directory, we have
our data set of interest, \texttt{Topgown\_Data}

\subsection{Reading in Data}\label{reading-in-data}

Now that we have our working directory set we can use the
\texttt{read\_csv()} function which requires one minimum argument to
work which is the name of your \texttt{.csv} file. Here we are setting
the variable \texttt{mydata} to the contents within the \texttt{.csv}
file. It stores the contents of \texttt{Topgown\_Data.csv} in what is
called a data frame. What is a dataframe? it is simply a matrix where
each row constitutes a variable (which can be any type you want), and
rows are observations.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\NormalTok{mydata =}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{read_csv}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"TopGown_Data.csv"}\NormalTok{, }\DataTypeTok{skip_empty_rows =} \OtherTok{TRUE}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## Warning: Missing column names filled in: 'X1' [1]
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
## Parsed with column specification:
## cols(
##   .default = col_double(),

##   predicted_word = col_character(),

\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}

\section{Dplyr() Package}\label{dplyr-package}

\subsection{select()}\label{select}

For this particular experiment we have two independent variables of
interest: \texttt{visual\_field} and \texttt{constrained\_to}; and four
participant variables of interest:
\texttt{zTOWRE\_Word},\texttt{zTOWRE\_Nonword},
\texttt{zSpelling\_Dictation},\texttt{zSpelling\_Recogntion}. What if we
are only interested in these variables, and we don't particularly need
word level variables such as \texttt{ortho\_N}, or \texttt{phono\_N}. We
can then select these variables.

For this particular function, the first argument is going to be the
dataset of interest. the dataset for we will be selecting from is
\texttt{mydata}. The following arguments are simply the columns you
would like to keep.

\subsubsection{The Pipe (\%\textgreater{}*\%)}\label{the-pipe}

However, another way I would suggest writing code like this is to use a
function in the \texttt{tidyverse} called the pipe
(\texttt{\%\textgreater{}\%}). Like the \texttt{select()} function, the
first argument in all \texttt{tidyverse} functions will be your dataset
of interest. The pipe simply gets a dataset, and pushes it into the
first argument of a function. Here is an example.

In this regard, the pipe follows simple logic. Once a dataset is
manipulated by one function, you pass it to the next function.

\subsection{arrange()}\label{arrange}

Let us say that we are interested in the word freqeuncy and orthographic
neighborhood size of a particular target word. we can arrange the these
variables so we can display the most frequent words going in ascending
order, and the words with the smallest orthographic neighborhood size in
descending order.
